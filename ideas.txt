DESIGN NOTES / IDEAS

1. Result set, row and column-level Modifiers

    Proposal 1: Fixed-length Format

        SELECT
            WIDTH(Symbol, 10) AS Symbol,
            WIDTH(Name, 64) AS Name,
            WIDTH(Sector, 30) AS Sector,
            WIDTH(Industry, 30) AS Industry,
            WIDTH(`Summary Quote`, 128) AS `Summary Quote`
        FROM 'companylist.csv'
        WHERE Industry = 'Oil/Gas Transmission'

        Comments: This works for writing fixed-length fields, but what about reading?

    Proposal 2: Fixed-length Format

        SELECT Symbol, Name, Sector, Industry, `Summary Quote`
        FROM 'companylist.csv'
        WHERE Industry = 'Oil/Gas Transmission'
        WITH FIXED COLUMNS (
            Symbol WIDTH 10,
            Name WIDTH 64,
            Sector WIDTH 30,
            Industry WIDTH 30,
            `Summary Quote` WIDTH 128
        )

        INSERT INTO 'fixed-data.txt' (Symbol, Name, Sector, Industry)
        WITH FIXED COLUMNS (
            Symbol WIDTH 8,
            Name WIDTH 32,
            Sector WIDTH 20,
            Industry WIDTH 20
        )
        SELECT Symbol, Name, Sector, Industry, `Summary Quote`
        FROM 'companylist.csv'
        WITH FIXED COLUMNS (
            Symbol WIDTH 10,
            Name WIDTH 64,
            Sector WIDTH 30,
            Industry WIDTH 30,
            `Summary Quote` WIDTH 128
        )
        WHERE Industry = 'Oil/Gas Transmission'

2. VIEWs

    CREATE VIEW 'OilAndGas' AS
    SELECT Symbol, Name, Sector, Industry, `Summary Quote`
    FROM 'companylist.csv'
    WHERE Industry = 'Oil/Gas Transmission';

3. Qwery URLs

    SELECT visitorId, adGroup, program, pageLabel, categoryId, referrerDomain
    FROM "kafka://dev001:9093?topic=weblogs&group_id=ldtest1"
    WITH JSON FORMAT
    WITH PROPERTIES "./kafka-auth.properties"
    LIMIT 5;

    SELECT visitorId, adGroup, program, pageLabel, categoryId, referrerDomain
    FROM "kafka://dev001:9093?topic=weblogs&group_id=ldtest1"
    WITH AVRO './pixall-v5.avsc'
    WITH PROPERTIES "./kafka-auth.properties"
    LIMIT 5;


    Proposals to change the device/source interface:

    proposal #1:
    ------------
    CONNECT TO 'S3'
    WITH PROPERTIES './aws-s3.properties'
    AS 'weblogs'

    CONNECT TO 'KAFKA'
    WITH PROPERTIES './kafka-auth.properties'
    AS 'weblogs'

    DISCONNECT FROM 'weblogs'

    SELECT visitorId, adGroup, program, pageLabel, categoryId, referrerDomain
    FROM 'weblogs.json'
    WITH JSON FORMAT
    WITH CONNECTION 'weblogs'
    LIMIT 5



SELECT * FROM '1495582154423.json' WITH JSON PATH ('data') LIMIT 1;

SELECT `data.Id`, `data.CreatedById`, `data.city`, `data.state`, `data.AnnualRevenue`, `data.Type`, `data.SystemModstamp` FROM '1495582154423.json';

SELECT Id, CreatedById, city, state, AnnualRevenue, Type, SystemModstamp FROM '1495582154423.json' WITH JSON PATH ('data');

DESCRIBE (SELECT * FROM '1495582154423.json' WITH JSON PATH ('data') LIMIT 1);
