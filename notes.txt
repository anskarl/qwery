DESIGN NOTES

1. Result set, row and column-level Modifiers

    a. Modifier Proposals - Implemented

        WITH CSV|PSV|TSV|JSON FORMAT
        WITH GZIP COMPRESSION
        WITH DELIMITER ','
        WITH QUOTED TEXT
        WITH QUOTED NUMBERS

    b. Text Formatting Proposals

        Proposal 1: CSV/PSV/TSV Format - Implemented

            SELECT Symbol, Name, Sector, Industry, `Summary Quote`
            FROM 'companylist.csv'
            WITH DELIMITER ','
            WITH QUOTED TEXT
            WITH QUOTED NUMBERS
            WHERE Industry = 'Oil/Gas Transmission'

            SELECT Symbol, Name, Sector, Industry, `Summary Quote`
            FROM 'companylist.csv'
            WITH PSV FORMAT
            WHERE Industry = 'Oil/Gas Transmission'

        Proposal 2: JSON Format

            SELECT Symbol, Name, Sector, Industry, `Summary Quote`
            FROM 'companylist.csv'
            WITH ROWS AS JSON
            WHERE Industry = 'Oil/Gas Transmission'

        Proposal 3: Fixed-length Format

            SELECT
                WIDTH(Symbol, 10) AS Symbol,
                WIDTH(Name, 64) AS Name,
                WIDTH(Sector, 30) AS Sector,
                WIDTH(Industry, 30) AS Industry,
                WIDTH(`Summary Quote`, 128) AS `Summary Quote`
            FROM 'companylist.csv'
            WHERE Industry = 'Oil/Gas Transmission'

            Comments: This works for writing fixed-length fields, but what about reading?

        Proposal 4: Fixed-length Format

            SELECT Symbol, Name, Sector, Industry, `Summary Quote`
            FROM 'companylist.csv'
            WHERE Industry = 'Oil/Gas Transmission'
            WITH FIXED COLUMNS (
                Symbol WIDTH 10,
                Name WIDTH 64,
                Sector WIDTH 30,
                Industry WIDTH 30,
                `Summary Quote` WIDTH 128
            )

            INSERT INTO 'fixed-data.txt' (Symbol, Name, Sector, Industry)
            WITH FIXED COLUMNS (
                Symbol WIDTH 8,
                Name WIDTH 32,
                Sector WIDTH 20,
                Industry WIDTH 20
            )
            SELECT Symbol, Name, Sector, Industry, `Summary Quote`
            FROM 'companylist.csv'
            WITH FIXED COLUMNS (
                Symbol WIDTH 10,
                Name WIDTH 64,
                Sector WIDTH 30,
                Industry WIDTH 30,
                `Summary Quote` WIDTH 128
            )
            WHERE Industry = 'Oil/Gas Transmission'
